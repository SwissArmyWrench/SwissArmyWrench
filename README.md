# Howdy folks.

My name is Nathan, but you can call me **SwissArmyWrench**. I am an amateur programmer since 2016 or something (I honestly don't remember specifically), primarily focusing on creating tools to improve workflows and automate tasks.

For my day job, I am an industrial maintenance technician, working in a car parts factory in Columbus, Ohio. I am in an apprenticeship, studying mechatronics. Eventually, I would like to become an automation engineer, manufacturing engineer, machine designer, or something in that wheelhouse. The code published here is intended to act as a portfolio to show real-life applications of my skills, but also as resources for others. 

My first language was Python. In 2023, I have commenced learning Rust and I have also been using AutoHotKey, which is an automation and scripting tool powered by its own language. I have dabbled in Kotlin, C++, C#, and I am reasonably comfortable in the Arduino language which is a modified version of C++.
